# Overview
This document provides an in-depth explanation of the key hyperparameters and functions used in the `deepseek_finetune.py` script. Understanding these elements is crucial for effectively fine-tuning the DeepSeek model for specific tasks and hardware configurations.

## Hyperparameters

### Model and Dataset Configuration
#### `model_name`
- **What it does:** Specifies the pre-trained model to load from Hugging Face.
- **How to change:** Replace with the identifier of another model available on Hugging Face.
- **When to change:** When you want to experiment with different models or architectures.

#### `dataset`
- **What it does:** Indicates the dataset used for training.
- **How to change:** Replace with the name of another dataset available on Hugging Face.

### Device Setup
#### `device`
- **What it does:** Determines whether to use a GPU or CPU for computation.
- **How to change:** Automatically set based on hardware availability; no manual change needed.

### LoRA Configuration
#### `lora_alpha`
- **What it does:** Controls the adaptation strength in LoRA fine-tuning.
- **How to change:** Increase for stronger adaptation, decrease for less.
- **When to change:** Adjust based on the complexity of the task and available compute resources.

#### `r` (LoRA rank)
- **What it does:** Determines the rank of the low-rank adaptation matrices.
- **How to change:** Increase for more expressiveness, decrease for less computation.
- **When to change:** When balancing between model expressiveness and computational efficiency.

### Training Arguments
#### `num_train_epochs`
- **What it does:** Specifies the number of complete passes through the training dataset.
- **How to change:** Increase for more thorough training, decrease for faster results.
- **When to change:** Adjust based on dataset size and desired model performance.

#### `per_device_train_batch_size`
- **What it does:** Sets the batch size per device (GPU/TPU/CPU).
- **How to change:** Increase for faster training if memory allows, decrease if encountering memory issues.
- **When to change:** Based on available memory and desired training speed.

#### `gradient_accumulation_steps`
- **What it does:** Accumulates gradients over multiple steps to simulate larger batch sizes.
- **How to change:** Increase to effectively use larger batch sizes without increasing memory usage.
- **When to change:** When limited by memory but needing larger batch sizes for stability.

#### `learning_rate`
- **What it does:** Initial learning rate for the optimizer.
- **How to change:** Increase for faster convergence, decrease to avoid overshooting.
- **When to change:** Based on model performance; adjust if the model is not learning effectively.

#### `fp16`
- **What it does:** Enables mixed precision training to reduce memory usage and increase speed.
- **How to change:** Set to `True` for compatible hardware, `False` otherwise.
- **When to change:** When using GPUs that support mixed precision (e.g., NVIDIA Volta and newer).

### Testing Parameters
#### `max_new_tokens`
- **What it does:** Maximum number of new tokens to generate during testing.
- **How to change:** Increase for longer outputs, decrease for shorter.
- **When to change:** Based on the desired length of the generated text.

#### `temperature`
- **What it does:** Controls randomness in the output; lower values make output more deterministic.
- **How to change:** Decrease for more focused outputs, increase for more creative outputs.
- **When to change:** Depending on the task; lower for factual tasks, higher for creative tasks.

#### `top_p`
- **What it does:** Nucleus sampling parameter that limits the token pool to a cumulative probability.
- **How to change:** Decrease to make output more focused, increase for more diversity.
- **When to change:** Adjust based on the desired diversity of the output.

## Functions

### `prepare_dataset(tokenizer)`
**Purpose:** Prepares the medical reasoning dataset for training by formatting and tokenizing the data.

#### How it works:
1. Loads the dataset from Hugging Face.
2. Formats each example with a custom prompt including the question, chain-of-thought reasoning, and final answer.
3. Uses a subset of the dataset for quick experimentation.
4. Tokenizes the text with settings optimized for speed.

#### When to modify:
- Adjust the `train_size` and `test_size` parameters for a full run.
- Change `max_length` if your use case requires longer sequences.
- Update the prompt format to suit different tasks or datasets.

### `setup_model()`
**Purpose:** Sets up the DeepSeek model with configurations tailored for efficient training.

#### How it works:
1. Loads the tokenizer and sets padding tokens.
2. Loads the model using the `from_pretrained` method with custom arguments for memory optimization.

#### When to modify:
- Change `torch_dtype` if you want to experiment with different precision.
- Adjust `max_memory` if your hardware configuration is different.
- Modify `use_cache` if caching is needed for inference.

### `setup_trainer(model, tokenizer, train_dataset, eval_dataset)`
**Purpose:** Sets up the `SFTTrainer` for LoRA-based fine-tuning.

#### How it works:
1. Configures LoRA with specified alpha, dropout, rank, and target modules.
2. Sets training hyperparameters like learning rate, batch size, gradient accumulation, and checkpointing.

#### When to modify:
- Adjust `peft_config` parameters (e.g., `lora_alpha`, `r`) to trade off between performance and resource usage.
- Change `training_args` (e.g., `num_train_epochs`, `per_device_train_batch_size`) based on your dataset size and compute.
- Enable or disable mixed precision (`fp16`/`bf16`) based on your device capabilities.

### `test_model(model_path)`
**Purpose:** Tests the fine-tuned model by generating a response for a sample medical reasoning problem.

#### How it works:
1. Loads the fine-tuned model and tokenizer with offloading settings.
2. Sets up a text-generation pipeline with recommended parameters.
3. Generates a response for a predefined test case and logs the output.

#### When to modify:
- Change the `test_problem` string to try different medical reasoning cases.
- Adjust pipeline parameters (e.g., `max_new_tokens`, `temperature`) to experiment with generation behavior.

### `main()`
**Purpose:** Orchestrates the complete fine-tuning workflow.

#### Workflow:
1. Set up the model and tokenizer.
2. Prepare the training dataset.
3. Configure and initialize the trainer with LoRA settings.
4. Run training.
5. Save the fine-tuned model.
6. Test the model with a sample prompt.
7. Finalize logging with Weights & Biases.

## Practical Tips
- **Experimentation:** Start with default values and adjust based on model performance and resource constraints.
- **Monitoring:** Use tools like Weights & Biases to track changes and their impacts on performance.
- **Resource Management:** Be mindful of memory and compute limitations, especially when adjusting batch sizes and precision settings.
